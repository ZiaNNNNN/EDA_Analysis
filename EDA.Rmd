Problem 1: CitiBike anomaly detection & neighborhood usage
```{r message=FALSE}
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcbonilla/BusinessAnalytics/master/BAData/JC-201709-citibike-tripdata.csv"
citibike = read.csv(url)
citibike = as.data.frame(citibike)
library(R.basic)
library(lubridate)
citibike$tripdur_z = zscore(citibike$tripduration, na.rm = TRUE)
age <- function(dob, age.day = today(), units = "years", floor = TRUE) {
  calc.age = interval(dob, age.day) / duration(num = 1, units = units)
  if (floor) return(as.integer(floor(calc.age)))
  return(calc.age)
}
citibike$birth.year = as.Date(citibike$birth.year, "%Y")
citibike$age = age(citibike$birth.year)
citibike$age_z = zscore(citibike$age, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r message=FALSE}
ab_trip = subset(citibike, tripdur_z > 3, select = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17))
head(ab_trip)
nrow(ab_trip)
```

```{r message=FALSE}
ab_age = subset(citibike, age_z > 3, select = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18))
head(ab_age)
nrow(ab_age)
```


```{r message=FALSE}
age_80 = subset(citibike, age > 80)
nrow(age_80)
```


There are 119 clients with age greater than 70, which contribute about 3.6% of total clients. And there are 37 
clients with age greater than 80, which contribut about 1.1% of total clients. Alought senior clients does not
contribute large part of clients, citibike should not ignore the corresponding policy regarding these age groups.
Citibike should give safety instruction to senior clients before their rides such as wearing halmet and following 
speed limitation. Also, providing recommendate corresponding injuring insurance to senior clients can minimize the 
cost in case of injuring during rides. 

```{r message=FALSE}
nrow(ab_trip)
```
Citibike should pay more attentaion on trips with anomalies. Specifically, there are 32 trips with during more than
12 hours. Although this is not a large amout, citibike should keep monitoring such long trips and consider about 
charge additional penalty fee to these trips. Having too many such long trips is harmful for the inventory.

Also, the average trip duration for clients age greater or equals to 120 and age lower than 20 are extremely high,
so we should consider about ignore these data because of the number of clients from these age groups only 
contribute a little percentage of total clients.


Problem 2: Aviation Accidents
```{r message=FALSE}
url2 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcbonilla/BusinessAnalytics/master/BAData/aviation.csv"
aviation = read.csv(url2)
aviation = as.data.frame(aviation)
aviation$fetal_status = gsub("[0-9]*", "", aviation$Injury.Severity)
aviation$fetal_status = gsub("[[:punct:]]", " ", aviation$fetal_status)

aviation$Date_Year = substring(aviation$Event.Date, 8, 11) 
aviation$Date_Year = as.Date(aviation$Date_Year, "%Y")
write.csv(aviation, "/Users/zianzhang/Desktop/nyu/business_analytics/HW3/aviation_rev.csv")
```
